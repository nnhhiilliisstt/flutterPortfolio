# Portfolio Website Using Flutter Web
A portfolio website built using flutter for web.

## Generating the Release Build
To generate the release build, run flutter build web<br>
This should output your release build inside the build/web folder.<br>
You can serve the website to your browser using any http server to see your see your website in action. I recommend using http-server. Or you can host it wherever you want!
